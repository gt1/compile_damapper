# compile_damapper
This project contains a script for compiling and installing damapper (https://github.com/thegenemyers/DAMAPPER) 
and damapper_bwt (https://github.com/gt1/damapper_bwt) as well as some support tools like 
lastools (see https://github.com/gt1/lastools), biobambam2 (see https://github.com/gt1/biobambam2) and DAZZ_DB (see https://github.com/thegenemyers/DAZZ_DB).

The script can be called using

```
bash compile_damapper.sh /path/to/installdir
```

Please see https://github.com/thegenemyers/DAMAPPER for using DAMAPPER to produce DALIGNER's LAS output format.

If you want BAM output files then please see the programs call.damapper (described at https://github.com/gt1/lastools)
and damapper_bwt (https://github.com/gt1/damapper_bwt).

Precompiled Linux x86_64 binaries can be found at https://github.com/gt1/damapper_bwt/releases .
